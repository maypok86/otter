## üí° Motivation <a id="motivation" />

I once came across the fact that none of the Go cache libraries are truly contention-free. Most of them are a map with a mutex and an eviction policy. Unfortunately, these are not able to reach the speed of caches in other languages (such as [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine)). For example, the fastest cache from Dgraph labs called [Ristretto](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ristretto), was faster than competitors by 30% at best (Otter is many times faster) but had [poor hit ratio](https://github.com/dgraph-io/ristretto/issues/336), even though its README says otherwise. This can be a problem in real-world applications, because no one wants to bump into performance of a cache library üôÇ. As a result, I wanted to make the fastest, easiest-to-use cache with excellent hit ratio.

Otter is based on the following papers:

## ‚ú® Features <a id="features" />

This library has lots of features such as:
- **Simple API**: Just set the parameters you want in the builder and enjoy
- **Autoconfiguration**: Otter is automatically configured based on the parallelism of your application
- **Generics**: You can safely use any comparable types as keys and any types as values
- **TTL**: Expired values will be automatically deleted from the cache
- **Cost-based eviction**: Otter supports eviction based on the cost of each item
- **Excellent performance**: Otter is currently the fastest cache library with a huge lead over the [competition](#performance)
- **Great hit ratio**: New S3-FIFO algorithm is used, which shows excellent [results](#hit-ratio)

### ‚úèÔ∏è Examples <a id="examples" />

Otter uses a builder pattern that allows you to conveniently create a cache object with different parameters

**Cache with const TTL**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/maypok86/otter"
)

func main() {
    // create a cache with capacity equal to 10000 elements
    cache, err := otter.MustBuilder[string, string](10_000).
        CollectStats().
        Cost(func(key string, value string) uint32 {
            return 1
        }).
        WithTTL(time.Hour).
        Build()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // set item with ttl (1 hour) 
    cache.Set("key", "value")

    // get value from cache
    value, ok := cache.Get("key")
    if !ok {
        panic("not found key")
    }
    fmt.Println(value)

    // delete item from cache
    cache.Delete("key")

    // delete data and stop goroutines
    cache.Close()
}
```

**Cache with variable TTL**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/maypok86/otter"
)

func main() {
    // create a cache with capacity equal to 10000 elements
    cache, err := otter.MustBuilder[string, string](10_000).
        CollectStats().
        Cost(func(key string, value string) uint32 {
            return 1
        }).
        WithVariableTTL().
        Build()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // set item with ttl (1 hour)
    cache.Set("key1", "value1", time.Hour)
    // set item with ttl (1 minute)
    cache.Set("key2", "value2", time.Minute)

    // get value from cache
    value, ok := cache.Get("key1")
    if !ok {
        panic("not found key")
    }
    fmt.Println(value)

    // delete item from cache
    cache.Delete("key1")

    // delete data and stop goroutines
    cache.Close()
}
```

### üöÄ Performance <a id="performance" />

Throughput benchmarks are a port of the caffeine [benchmarks](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/blob/master/caffeine/src/jmh/java/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/GetPutBenchmark.java) in Golang.

#### Read (100%)

In this [benchmark](https://github.com/maypok86/benchmarks/blob/main/perf/bench_test.go) **8 threads** concurrently read from a cache configured with a maximum size.

<img width="60%" src="assets/results/reads=100,writes=0.png" alt="reads=100%,writes=0%" />

#### Read (75%) / Write (25%)

In this [benchmark](https://github.com/maypok86/benchmarks/blob/main/perf/bench_test.go) **6 threads** concurrently read from and **2 threads** write to a cache configured with a maximum size.

<img width="60%" src="assets/results/reads=75,writes=25.png" alt="reads=75%,writes=25%" />

#### Read (50%) / Write (50%)

In this [benchmark](https://github.com/maypok86/benchmarks/blob/main/perf/bench_test.go) **4 threads** concurrently read from and **4 threads** write to a cache configured with a maximum size.

#### Read (25%) / Write (75%)

In this [benchmark](https://github.com/maypok86/benchmarks/blob/main/perf/bench_test.go) **2 threads** concurrently read from and **6 threads** write to a cache configured with a maximum size.

#### Write (100%)

Otter shows fantastic speed under all loads except extreme write-heavy, but such a load is very rare for caches and usually indicates that the cache has a very small hit ratio.

### üéØ Hit ratio <a id="hit-ratio" />

#### Zipf

<img width="60%" src="./assets/results/zipf.png" alt="zipf" />

#### S3

This trace is described as "disk read accesses initiated by a large commercial search engine in response to various web search requests."

<img width="60%" src="./assets/results/s3.png" alt="s3" />

#### DS1

This trace is described as "a database server running at a commercial site running an ERP application on top of a commercial database."

<img width="60%" src="./assets/results/ds1.png" alt="ds1" />

#### P3

The trace P3 was collected from workstations running Windows NT by using Vtrace
which captures disk operations through the use of device
filters

<img width="60%" src="./assets/results/p3.png" alt="p3" />

#### P8

The trace P8 was collected from workstations running Windows NT by using Vtrace
which captures disk operations through the use of device
filters

<img width="60%" src="./assets/results/p8.png" alt="p8" />

#### LOOP

This trace demonstrates a looping access pattern.

<img width="60%" src="./assets/results/loop.png" alt="loop" />

#### OLTP

This trace is described as "references to a CODASYL database for a one hour period."

<img width="60%" src="./assets/results/oltp.png" alt="oltp" />

In summary, we have that S3-FIFO (otter) is inferior to W-TinyLFU (theine) on lfu friendly traces (databases, search, analytics), but has a greater or equal hit ratio on web traces.
