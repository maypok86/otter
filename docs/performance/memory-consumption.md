# Memory consumption

### Description

These benchmarks use pre-generated strings as keys and values, i.e., each key-value pair occupies 32 bytes. The implementations are run with the expiration policy enabled to check the amount of memory it consumes. This is also the most common cache usage scenario.

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/maypok86/benchmarks/blob/main/memory/main.go), and the results in text form [here](https://github.com/maypok86/benchmarks/blob/main/memory/results/memory.txt).

### Capacity (1000)

In this benchmark, the cache capacity is 1000 elements.

### Conclusion

Otter just shows good results at all capacities, even despite the use of additional buffers.

Please note that in reality, ristretto is likely to use less RAM than the rest of the caches. This is achieved thanks to a dirty hack, due to which ristretto does not store keys at all and replaces them with two hashes.
